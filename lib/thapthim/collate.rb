module Thapthim
  # EXPERIMENTAL — NOT YET VERIFIED. The unit tests pass, but this has not been validated against the
  # dictionary at scale or reviewed by the author; treat the ordering as provisional until then.
  #
  # Thai dictionary collation, following the Royal Society of Thailand (ราชบัณฑิตยสภา) ordering
  # (rules: https://th.wikibooks.org/wiki/วิธีเรียงลำดับคำตามตัวอักษรในภาษาไทย — encoded in test_collate.rb).
  # Native Ruby sorts Thai by codepoint, which is wrong: the pre-posed vowels เ แ โ ใ ไ are written
  # before their consonant but sort after it, so codepoint order scatters เก/ไก words away from their
  # base consonant. This module fixes that with two rules — (1) reorder a leading vowel after the
  # consonant it precedes, and (2) treat tone marks as a secondary level so ปา < ป่า < ป้า.
  #
  # Pure Ruby, no engine dependency. Where to use it BEYOND a one-off sort:
  #   * Any Enumerable ordering of Thai text — sort_by / min_by / max_by / Enumerable#sort — e.g.
  #     dropdowns, autocomplete, contact and product lists, or A–Z index/glossary pages.
  #   * A database sort column: store `thai_sort_key(name)` in an indexed column and `ORDER BY` it,
  #     so SQL returns Thai in dictionary order (DB collations for Thai are usually missing or wrong)
  #     — and it composes with pagination. The key is an opaque, comparable binary String.

  # Consonants ก–ฮ in alphabet order (ฤ placed after ร, ฦ after ล, as the dictionary does).
  COLLATION_CONSONANTS = "กขฃคฅฆงจฉชซฌญฎฏฐฑฒณดตถทธนบปผฝพฟภมยรฤลฦวศษสหฬอฮ"
  # Primary order = consonants, then the vowel signs in dictionary order.
  COLLATION_PRIMARY = "#{COLLATION_CONSONANTS}ะัาำิีึืุูเแโใไๅ"
  # Secondary (compared only after the primary letters tie): maitaikhu, the four tone marks, then
  # thanthakhat (การันต์) and nikhahit. "No mark" ranks 0, below all of these.
  COLLATION_SECONDARY = "็่้๊๋์ํ"
  # The pre-posed (leading) vowels that must be reordered after their consonant.

  # Sort Thai strings by dictionary order. Without a block, sorts an array of strings; with a block,

  # Build the collation key for a string: an opaque binary String that compares (`<=>`, sort_by) and
  # stores (a DB sort column) in Royal-Institute order. Layout: primary letter weights, a 0x0000
  # separator, the secondary tone weights, then the reordered text as a final tiebreaker — each level
  # dominates the next. Non-Thai characters sort after Thai, ordered by codepoint (a Thai collator, so
  # rare astral-plane characters may share a bucket). Inherits sanitize_input hardening.
